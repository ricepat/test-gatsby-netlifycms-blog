title: Who loves pink flowers?
intro: >-
  Me, that's who! I love flowers in general, but pink blooms are my absolute
  favorite. There's something about the color pink in plants that makes me feel
  energetic. I'm not quite sure why that is, but that's always been a thing for
  me.


  Anyways, pink flowers are super cute! They're super cool! They don't always smell good, but that's always the case, right? Ahaha~
